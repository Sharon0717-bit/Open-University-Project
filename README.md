Open University Learning Analytics dataset
Learning Analytics focuses on the collection and analysis of learnersâ€™ data to improve their learning experience by providing informed guidance and to optimise learning materials. To support the research in this area we have developed a dataset, containing data from courses presented at the Open University (OU).
